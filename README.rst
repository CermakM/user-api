Thoth Core user-facing API
==========================

This API is as a user-facing service, and part of `Thoth Core project <https://github.com/thoth-station/core>`_.

It's main aim is to provide a management service that can be used directly by users for the `thoth-middeend` part. See `Thoth-core <https://github.com/thoth-station/core>`_ for more details.

The service is built using OpenShift Source-to-Image. See also `s2i-python-container README <https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-python-container>`_ for more info.

Python 3.6 is required to run this application.
